Hello, I'm Ken Girard.

Currently doing the LaunchCode101 course (https://www.launchcode.org/). JavaScript, Truetype, Angular, HTML, CSS, Java, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, MySQL. 

I've been playing with code most of my life, first writing BASIC on my Atari 800, then learning some Cobal, Pascal & Fortran. When the internet became the place to be, like most of us I was on MySpace, changing and modifying my page, helping folks do stuff with theirs. There were a lot of really ugly pages made back then. Eventually moved on to having some of my own web pages, and around 2006 I got involved with an open source project called [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), made a couple of simple apps for it, and am using TW to take notes on my class (https://programing-notes-101.tiddlyhost.com/)

Eventually a lot more will go on here, making it more resume like, but for now this will have to do.
